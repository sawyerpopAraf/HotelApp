 HotelApp is a C# and .Net MVP app with a booking system for customers (Razor page) and a check-in system for hotel co-workers (WPF).

The database is primarily SQL Server, but it is also possible to switch to SQLite. All you need to do is change the app settings in both the webpage and WPF from "Sql" to "Sqlite".
